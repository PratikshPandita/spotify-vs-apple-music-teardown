## 2. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

- **Spotify**: Global ARPU ~ $5–6/month (varies by market). In India, premium ARPU is lower due to ₹119 pricing, but high subscriber count offsets it. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Apple Music**: Likely similar ARPU in key markets ($10.99 individual), but bundling skews effective ARPU per service.
